# CamLab-OffAxisCamera-Setup

Program to assist with setting up a camera for off-axis holographic imaging. Allows:
- Three different cameras to be set up
- Camera parameters such as exposure and triggering to be set up
- Off-axis holography regions to be set up. i.e., the region of interest in real space and the region of interest in inverse space
- Images to be displayed of the raw captured image, the inverse space image, and the final complex fields. Single and continuous capture is available for each type of captured image
- Camera parameters to be saved to a txt file so that the set up camera can be used by other CamLab programs.

Tip: To set a region of interest, click-and-drag on the image.
